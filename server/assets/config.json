Geoscience Australia has compiled the following: (1) Regional biostratigraphy (70 columns) with complete references, and (2) Detailed lithostratigraphy for all hydrocarbon-rich basins (including oil-gas levels with reference wells) (ca. 300 columns), and we added (3) Precambrian and other Phanerozoic basins (150 columns). Each lithology formation has pop-ups that include URL-links to the GA lexicon, the header for each Phanerozoic basin has links to location maps, and all oil-gas levels are linked to the GA well database. [NOTE: Contact Andrew Kelman <Andrew.Kelman@ga.gov.au> for a special Public 'GA-TS_Creator' JAVA version (ca. 25 Mb) that has this Australian dataset and their extensive reconstruction images pre-installed with the full global suite.]",
